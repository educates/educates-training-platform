# Scenarios

There's some scenarios we want to cover and test. We can print the list of scenarios and the
test file by executing:

```
./test-scenarios.sh --help
```

We can run the scenarios by executing:

```
./test-scenarios.sh
```

If you want to see the processed config generated by each scenario:

```
./test-scenarios.sh --debug
```

If you want to see things `TODO` for an scenario:

```
./test-scenarios.sh --todo
```

**NOTE** Take into account that values are mock, so if you really want to test these scenarios into a cluster
make a copy and alter the values to your needs.

**NOTE** You will need to have a cluster to test on the cluster

## Scenarios implemented

Prerequisites:

- Add tls and ca secret to local cache

```
educates admin secrets add tls educates-example-com-fromcache-tls --cert minica/educates.example.com/cert.pem --key minica/educates.example.com/key.pem --domain educates.example.com
educates admin secrets add ca educates-example-com-fromcache-ca --cert minica/minica.pem --domain educates.example.com
```

The name of secrets are different depending on whether they should come from the cache, that will have `fromcache` in the name

1. kind-scenario-01: kind with no certs and kyverno
1. kind-scenario-02: kind with no certs and psp
1. kind-scenario-03: kind with tlsCertificateRef for educates
1. kind-scenario-03b: kind with tlsCertificateRef for educates when they are in local secrets cache (This is like 1 but using `--with-local-secrets` from CLI)
1. kind-scenario-04: kind with tlsCertificateRef and caCertificateRef for educates
1. kind-scenario-04b: kind with tlsCertificateRef and caCertificateRef for educates when they are in local secrets cache (This is like 1 but using `--with-local-secrets` from CLI)
1. kind-scenario-05: kind with tlsCertificate for educates
1. kind-scenario-06: kind with tlsCertificate and caCertificate for educates
1. kind-scenario-07: kind with infrastructure.caCertificateRef and cert-manager enabled
1. kind-scenario-07b: kind with infrastructure.caCertificateRef and cert-manager enabled when they are in local secrets cache(This is like 7 but using `--with-local-secrets` from CLI)
1. kind-scenario-08: kind with without educates
1. kind-scenario-08b: kind with without educates and without using a clusterSecurity policy engine
1. kind-scenario-08c: kind without educates package without using a clusterSecurity policy engine but with tls certificate provided for the domain

1. **NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET** kind-scenario-10: kind with local images for educates
1. **NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET** kind-scenario-11: kind with caCertificateRef from provided pem file via CLI arg
